**A modern monorepo project with Electron, React Native, and TypeScript**

</div>

## 📋 Overview

Alius is a well-organized monorepo managed with Turborepo, designed to create scalable applications with a shared codebase. The project leverages TypeScript throughout to ensure type safety and provide a consistent development experience. It features both desktop (Electron) and mobile (React Native/Expo) applications that can communicate via WebSockets.

## ✨ Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Managed by Turborepo for efficient dependency management and build processes
- **Electron App**: Cross-platform desktop application powered by Electron and React
- **Mobile App**: React Native (Expo) application for iOS and Android
- **Cross-Device Communication**: WebSocket connectivity between desktop and mobile applications
- **QR Code Integration**: Easily connect mobile devices to desktop app via QR code scanning
- **Shared Packages**: Reusable UI components, configurations, and utilities
- **Strong Typing**: 100% TypeScript for better developer experience and code reliability
- **Consistent Code Style**: Enforced through ESLint and Prettier
- **Git Hooks**: Automated checks using Husky to maintain code quality
- **Versioning**: Standardized release process with changelogs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 10 or higher
- For mobile development: Expo Go app on your device or emulator/simulator

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alius.git
   cd alius
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Run all applications and packages in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Run the Electron application specifically:

```sh
npx turbo run electron:dev --filter=electron-app
```

Run the Mobile application:

```sh
npx turbo run android --filter=mobile-app
# or
cd apps/mobile-app
npm start
```

### Building

Build all applications and packages:

```sh
npm run build
```

## 📱 Mobile-Desktop Connectivity

The mobile app can connect to the desktop application via:

1. QR code scanning (generated by the desktop app)
2. Manual IP and port entry

Both applications must be on the same WiFi network for connectivity. The default WebSocket port is 8080.

## 📝 Code Standards

### File Naming

We use `kebab-case` for all file names:

✅ `user-service.ts`, `button-component.tsx`  
❌ `UserService.ts`, `buttonComponent.tsx`

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code changes (no new features/fixes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Routine tasks/maintenance
- `revert`: Revert previous commit
- `wip`: Work in progress
- `version`: Version updates (triggers automatic version bump)

**Examples**:

- `feat(ui): add new button component`
- `fix(api): resolve authentication issue`
- `docs: update setup instructions`
- `version: prepare for v1.2.0 release`

## 🔄 Versioning

```sh
# Create a new release with version bump and changelog
npm run release

# Create a release manually
npm run release:manual

# Update changelog without bumping version or creating tags
npm run changelog-only
```

# Version Update Process

When you need to increase the version number of this project, use the specific `version` commit type. This is the **only** commit type that will trigger the automatic version increment.

Example of a version commit:

```sh
git commit -m "version: bump to next version"
```

After making a version commit, run the release command:

```sh
npm run release
```

This will:

1. Analyze commit messages since the last tag
2. Determine the appropriate version increment (major, minor, patch)
3. Update version numbers in package.json files
4. Update the CHANGELOG.md file
5. Commit these changes with message "version: x.x.x"
6. Create a new git tag

Do not use `chore`, `build`, or other commit types for version changes.
